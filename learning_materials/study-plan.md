My path to get there:

started trying out some easy problems

took an short online course to learn basic python syntax and data types

tried some of the very popular problems for 2 weeks, was trying to reinvent the wheel on some of these problems.

Did this full explore card, helped me learn all of the basic data structures and simple techniques, and gave me focused
practice on a bunch of areas. This allowed me to recognize patterns and improve implementations. Learned a lot about
queues, stacks, strings, arrays, heaps, DP, backtracking, linked lists. This probably took me 2-3 weeks to finish?
Alternatively you could use neetcode, his video explanations are quite good.

5) Started virtual contests to see what I didn't know

6) Wasn't feeling great on DP and wanted more practice beyond what was in the DSA explore card, so I did DP explore
   card, which had tougher problems. This helped me a ton in learning recursive algorithms. Understanding the number of
   potential states, caching, recurrence relation all improved my understanding of DP.

6) More practice contests, started struggling on graph problems. Did the heap explore card.

7) Did the Graph explore card. Learned Djikstra's, union find, prims, and improved a ton with BFS/DFS, all of which have
   served me very well in contest problems. I feel like this card really unlocked a lot of Q3s and Q4s for me.

8) binary search was very annoying until I found this post. Do every single problem in here with his template, it's
   super useful.

9) Started struggling on bitwise/binary problems and contests were giving binary problems fairly often. Had been
   avoiding this topic but finally confronted it. Tried to work as many problems as I could and did this explore card.

Once I learned this I moved on to bitmask DP (still struggling with this one). This is a good problem to try and fully
understand.

Then I learned Trie's. LC has a small explore card for that as well and it's a necessary structure to know for some
problems.

In between all this I did maybe 100-150 practice contests. Gave me a bunch of exposure to different problems and kept me
motivated to improve (racing against the clock is fun and I don't want to get a bad rank).
